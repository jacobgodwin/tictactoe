# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe Game built for the Odin Project.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate the use and understanding of JavaScript modules and factory functions. I realize that I could have included all game assets inside one module but wanted to learn about private and public functions and variable and how to access them outside of the module, which is why there is a `gameBoard` module and `displayController` module.
